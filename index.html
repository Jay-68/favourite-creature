  <h1>The Legend of the Mythical Creature.</h1>
  <h3>A Brief History</h3>
  <p>
    The Phoenix is a mythological bird known throughout all cultures and all ages. When it dies, the bird bursts into
    flames and is reborn from its own ashes, making it immortal. Each life is said to be between 500 and 1000 years.
    Crimson and gold accent most depictions of this majestic creature, although other colors such as blue or purple are
    often included. With the attractiveness of a peacock and the size of an eagle, this bird symbolizes beauty and
    strength. The Phoenix's cry is considered to be a beautiful sound much like an elegant song. Through its beauty and
    unusual death, the Phoenix has come to be a symbol of immortality, renewal, and rebirth.
